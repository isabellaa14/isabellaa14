- 4th year Pychology Major ðŸ“š
- **Why Psych?** I originally wanted to persue a degree in criminology or another field related to law & justice, but found myself drawn to psych after watching too many true crime shows during covid and spending a long time wondering ***<span style="color:pink">what leads someone to commit a crime?</span>*** Because of that I decided to major in psychology and take a lot of classes related to forensics and psychopathology. 
- **Why PSYO 3505?** I wanted to branch out and learn something outside my comfort zone. I took CSCI 1105 ðŸ’» in my first year and it was such a nice challenge, so I decided to look for another course that involves coding somehow and looks like it could challenge me. 
- **Future Plans?** After my undergrad I want to travel for a year or two ðŸŒŽ going to all the normal tourist destinations like Western Europe and Australia, but also other smaller less touristy countries throughout the Eurasian continent. After that I'll *probably* go to grad school for a master's degree in psychology.
